2023 Libya Flood, Derna City

Theme 3: Integrating GIS and Remotely Sensed Data
for Urban Flood Loss Assessment and Recovery Planning

##Key Findings

The floods in Derna have caused widespread damage to public infrastructure, homes, and businesses. The city's roads and bridges were severely damaged, making it difficult for people to get around and access essential services. Many public buildings, including hospitals, schools, and government offices, were also damaged or destroyed. In addition, thousands of homes were destroyed or damaged, leaving many people homeless. We urge the relevant authorities to develop a comprehensive plan for reducing the risk of future flooding by working with disaster mitigation experts. This plan should include measures such as zoning restrictions in flood-prone areas, elevation of buildings above flood levels, restoration of flood plains and infrastructure for flood mitigation, development of early warning systems and education of the public about flood risk and preparedness.
